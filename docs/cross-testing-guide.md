# RebelSUITE Cross-Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides detailed guidance for cross-testing the RebelSUITE ecosystem. While each component has its own testing framework, cross-testing is essential to ensure that all components work together seamlessly as an integrated suite. This guide outlines the cross-testing approach, test scenarios, and best practices for verifying the integration between RebelSUITE components.

## Cross-Testing Principles

### 1. End-to-End Workflow Testing

Test complete workflows that span multiple components:
- **Design-to-Development**: CAD model creation in RebelCAD → game asset import in RebelENGINE → scripting in RebelCODE
- **Automation Workflows**: Workflow creation in RebelFLOW → execution across other components
- **Code-to-Execution**: Code writing in RebelDESK → compilation and execution in other components

### 2. Data Exchange Verification

Verify that data can be correctly exchanged between components:
- **File Format Compatibility**: Ensure files created in one component can be opened in another
- **Data Integrity**: Verify that data remains intact when transferred between components
- **Version Compatibility**: Test compatibility between different versions of components

### 3. Performance Impact Assessment

Measure how components affect each other's performance:
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage when multiple components are running
- **Startup Time**: Measure startup time when components are launched together
- **Responsiveness**: Test UI responsiveness when multiple components are active

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms:
- **Component Crashes**: Verify that a crash in one component doesn't affect others
- **Data Corruption**: Test recovery from corrupted shared data
- **Network Failures**: Verify behavior when network communication between components fails

## Cross-Testing Infrastructure

### 1. Test Environment Setup

```powershell
# Script to set up cross-testing environment
.\scripts\setup_cross_testing_environment.ps1
```

This script:
- Creates a dedicated test directory
- Sets up test data for all components
- Configures components for cross-testing
- Initializes logging for cross-component communication

### 2. Component Launcher

```powershell
# Script to launch multiple components for testing
.\scripts\launch_components.ps1 -components "RebelCAD,RebelENGINE,RebelFLOW"
```

This script:
- Launches specified components with test configuration
- Establishes communication channels between components
- Monitors component status and logs
- Provides a unified console for controlling all components

### 3. Test Scenario Runner

```powershell
# Script to run predefined cross-component test scenarios
.\scripts\run_cross_test_scenario.ps1 -scenario "CAD_to_ENGINE_workflow"
```

This script:
- Loads a predefined test scenario
- Executes the scenario across multiple components
- Captures results and logs
- Validates the outcome against expected results

### 4. Result Validator

```powershell
# Script to validate results across components
.\scripts\validate_cross_test_results.ps1 -testId "CT-001"
```

This script:
- Collects test results from all components
- Compares results against expected outcomes
- Generates a validation report
- Identifies any discrepancies or issues

## Cross-Component Test Scenarios

5. Verify the model is generated correctly
6. Modify parameters and regenerate the model
7. Test model validity and constraints

**Validation Criteria**:
- Script executes without errors
- Model is generated according to specifications
- Parameter changes produce expected model variations
- Performance is within acceptable limits

### 3. FLOW-to-DESK-to-ENGINE Workflow

**Scenario ID**: CT-003  
**Components**: RebelFLOW, RebelDESK, RebelENGINE  
**Description**: Create a workflow in RebelFLOW that generates code in RebelDESK and executes it in RebelENGINE

**Test Steps**:
1. Launch RebelFLOW
2. Create a workflow that defines game behavior logic
3. Generate code from the workflow
4. Open the generated code in RebelDESK
5. Compile and validate the code
6. Launch RebelENGINE
7. Import and execute the code
8. Test the behavior in a game scene

**Validation Criteria**:
- Workflow correctly generates functional code
- Code compiles without errors in RebelDESK
- Behavior in RebelENGINE matches workflow definition

### 4. Multi-Component Asset Pipeline

**Scenario ID**: CT-004  
**Components**: All RebelSUITE components  
**Description**: Test the complete asset pipeline across all components

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a 3D model in RebelCAD
2. Process the model through RebelFLOW automation
3. Generate scripts in RebelCODE
4. Edit and refine code in RebelDESK
5. Import assets and code into RebelENGINE

## Cross-Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management

- **Use Version-Controlled Test Assets**: Maintain a repository of test assets for cross-component testing
- **Create Realistic Test Scenarios**: Design test scenarios that reflect real-world usage

- **Size Limitations**: Check if large files are handled correctly

### 2. Communication Failures

- **Port Conflicts**: Verify that components use unique port numbers
- **Firewall Blocking**: Check if firewalls are blocking inter-process communication
- **Timeout Issues**: Adjust timeout settings for slower operations
- **Protocol Mismatches**: Ensure components use compatible communication protocols

### 3. Resource Contention

- **Memory Exhaustion**: Monitor memory usage and implement limits
- **CPU Overutilization**: Implement throttling for CPU-intensive operations
- **Disk I/O Bottlenecks**: Optimize disk access patterns
- **GPU Resource Conflicts**: Manage GPU resource allocation between components
